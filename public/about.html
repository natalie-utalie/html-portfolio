<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a language teacher with a master's degree in pedagogy and over seven years of diverse instructional experience. Being fluent in English and Russian, I am adept at teaching both children and adults.</p>

<p>My teaching journey began with a childhood love for languages. I was always fascinated by the idea of understanding people from around the world, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics. It was during my time as a tutor and volunteer in university projects that I discovered my true passion for teaching. This transformative experience inspired me to shift my focus to pedagogy, eventually earning a Master's degree in the field. Studying at university not only deepened my love for teaching but also equipped me with crucial academic skills necessary for educating people effectively.</p>

<p>In addition, I'm diving into the exciting world of front-end web development. So, I hope to become a linguist who can decode both human and machine languages.</p>
